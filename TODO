Stuff that needs doing (in random order):

- Preferences (dialog, class) - Use the ConfigParser module?
- Accelerators for EVERYTHING!
- Other scaling options (fit page, normal size)
- setup.py
- Speed up the rescaling when the window changes size
- Find a better background image for the webpage
- Bookmarking pages
- Bookmarks editor
- Using an idle handler to preload and pack the images causes the UI to
  block for a second or so. See about doing this withing the worker
  thread.
- The file command (and python library) sometimes identifies (zip) files
  as simply "data" instead of "Zip archive data...". Figure out what's
  causing this or work around it somehow.

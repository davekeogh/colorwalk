Stuff that needs doing (in random order):

- Preferences (dialog, class) - Use the ConfigParser module?
- Accelerators for EVERYTHING!
- setup.py
- Speed up the rescaling when the window changes size
- Bookmarking pages
- Bookmarks editor
- Using an idle handler to preload and pack the images causes the UI to
  block for a second or so. See about doing this withing the worker
  thread.
- Don't try to go forward/backward if the image isn't preloaded yet.
  Perhaps figure out someway to defer the callback so that the button
  press isn't lost though.
- Log all command line output, files opened, errors thrown. 
- Create a log file viewer as well.

Stuff that needs doing (in random order):

- Preferences (dialog, class) - Use the ConfigParser module?
- Accelerators for EVERYTHING!
- Other scaling options (fit page, normal size)
- Jump to page using the entry on the toolbar
- About dialog (low priority, or lowest?)
- README
- setup.py
- Speed up the rescaling when the window changes size
- Find a better background image for the webpage
- Test using python-magic to determine file types (time it too)
- Bookmarking pages
- Bookmarks editor
- ...
